What is ntopng
##############

ntopng is a web-based traffic monitoring application able to:

- Passive monitor traffic by passively capturing network traffic
- Collect network flows (NetFlow, sFlow and IPFIX)
- Actively monitor selected network devices
- Monitor a network infrastructure via SNMP

The main difference between ntopng and a traffic collector, is that ntopng not only reports traffic statistics but it also analizes the traffic, draws conclusions on observed traffic type and reports cybersecurity metrics.
